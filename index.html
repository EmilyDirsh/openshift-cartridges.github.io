            <h1>What's a Cartridge?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
            A cartridge is a pluggable piece of a software stack that can be added to an application. Cartridges provide runtimes, databases, and middleware. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The OpenShift team builds and maintains a lot of the most popular runtimes and databases, but anyone who wants to use something less-well-known, brand new, really old, or just plain different, can build and share a community cartridge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Community cartridges can be used in OpenShift Online, OpenShift Origin, and OpenShift Enterprise (?) TODO: is this true?
        </p>

        <h1>Use a Community Cartridge</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
        Community cartridges have a URL where OpenShift can download the packaged cartridge. Once you know the URL, you can use it with the normal <code>rhc</code> commands.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Runtime cartridges
    </h2>
    <p>
        These are cartridges that provide an application runtime. Examples include Wildfly and Go. Applications can only use a single runtime cartridge, so these have to be added to a new application when it is created.
        <pre><code>rhc create app [URL]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Other cartridges
    </h2>
    <p>
        Non-runtime cartridges can be added anytime after the application is created.
        <pre><code>rhc cartridge add [URL]</code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Note: The web console also supports community cartridges, both creating an application from one and adding one to an existing application.</em>
